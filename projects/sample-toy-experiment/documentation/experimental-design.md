# Experimental Design — Sample Toy Experiment

## Research question
Can we reliably estimate a coin's bias and validate that our inference code is correct?

## Hypotheses
- H0: Estimated bias is not statistically distinguishable from 0.5.
- H1: Estimated bias differs from 0.5 for a biased coin dataset.

## Metrics
- Primary: absolute error |p_hat - p_true|
- Secondary: confidence interval coverage
