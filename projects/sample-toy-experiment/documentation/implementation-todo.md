# Implementation TODO — Sample Toy Experiment

## Completed
- [x] (T1) Add `experiments/coinflip.py` runnable locally
- [x] (T2) Add config files for queued experiments
- [x] (T3) Add minimal tests (smoke + correctness)
- [x] (T4) Add SLURM sbatch script for Q-001
- [x] (T5) Run Q-001 locally (p_hat=0.5977, matches hypothesis)

## Blocked
- [ ] (T6) Submit Q-001 to SLURM - requires SLURM-enabled environment (sbatch not available on macOS)
